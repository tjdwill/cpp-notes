# cpp-notes

Notes on C++ (language, build, libraries, etc.). This is
less of an all-encompassing, super-fine-grained tutorial
and more of a collection of things I've had to learn in
order to feel more comfortable with the language.

In addition to language basics, I write about learning the
build process, libraries I use, etc.
